## Activation Extraction Tool

This tool is designed to extract neural activations from pre-trained models, specifically focusing on the CLIP RN50x4 architecture, penultimate layer of image encoder. It provides a user-friendly interface for obtaining activations from various layers of the model.

### Key Features
- **Single Image Activation Extraction**: Extract activations from a single image for detailed analysis.
- **Layer-wise Activation Extraction**: Extract activations from specific layers of the CLIP model.
- **Flexible Input**: Support for various image formats and preprocessing options.

### Usage

See the worked example in `Example_Extraction.ipynb`.

### Full Layer Activation Extraction

Run the `extract_full_layer_activations` function to obtain activations from the full layer of the CLIP model. Or download them directly (see Data/ folder)
